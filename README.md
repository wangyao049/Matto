* The biggest mistake people make in life is not trying to make a living at doing what they most enjoy.

* Failure is success if we learn from it.

* All things are difficult before they are easy.

* A ship in harbor is safe   
-but that is not what ship are built for.

* Yesterday is history; tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift, which is why we call it present.

* The reason why people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go, instead of how far they have gotten.
