* The biggest mistake people make in life is not trying to make a living at doing what they most enjoy.
-----
* Failure is success if we learn from it.
----
* *All things are difficult before they are easy.*
----
* A ship in harbor is safe,      
-but that is not what ship are built for.
----
* There is no such thing as failure, just lessons to be learnt on the way.
-----
* Yesterday is history; tomorrow is a mystery.    
Today is a gift, which is why we call it present.
-----
* The reason why people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go, instead of how far they have gotten.
-----
* Everything is possible. The impossible just takes longer.
-----
* Nobody ever got ready by waiting. You only get ready by starting.
-----
* No matter how bad or slow things go, you're still way ahead of everyone who isn't even trying.
